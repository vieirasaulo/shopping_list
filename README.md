# Shopping list

Training repo to manage a GitHub repositories and projects.


## Set-up 101 for git/ GitHub projects


### Set-up the project
1. Choose your code editor (I recommend VSCode)
2. Download and install git, and create a GitHub account
3. Fork shopping_list repo
5. [Create an ssh key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-zX_qc2S-M)
6. Clone your forked version of the repository locally
    - ```git clone git@github <INSERT SSH ORIGIN>```
7. Set the url for your forked repo
   - set an origin url
     - ```git remote set-url origin <INSERT SSH ORIGIN OF FORKED REPO>```
     - the origin should be your forked repo
   - set upstream url
     - ```git remote add upstream <INSERT SSH ORIGIN OF ORIGINAL REPO>```
   - update your forked version (see Workflow to update your forked version in [contributing](./contributing.md))
it's nice to learn new things
